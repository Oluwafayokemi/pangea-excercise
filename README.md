# Pangea Coding Challenge
Recreating luminskin.com product page and cart using a GraphQL API.

## Product Page Reqiurements
- Should query endpoint, retrieve the products and display them in a grid.
- Each item should display the image, title, price and a "Add to Cart" button.
- For screens wider than 768px, it should show grid of 3 items, for less than 768px wide it should show a grid of two wide.

## Cart Reqiurements
- When a user clicks "Add to Cart" on an item it should open the cart sidebar and add the item in.
- If the item already exists it should increment the quantity.
- Clicking the + or - buttons will increase or descrease the quantity, if the quantity is 1 and the "-" button is pressed it should remove the item.
- In the top left there is a currency select, doing so should requery the GraphQL api with a new currency and update the prices.
- It should sum the items in the cart and display them in the correct selected currency.
- Ignore anything related to subscriptions
